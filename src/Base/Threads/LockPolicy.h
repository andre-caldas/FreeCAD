 * @brief Implements the following policy: (see README.md)
 * 1. A `ExclusiveLock` is allowed to be called if the same thread already has a `ExclusiveLock`.
 *    But only if all mutexes being  are in fact already .
 *    Otherwise, a `ExclusiveLock` cannot be constructed by a thread that already owns any kind of lock on any mutex.
 *    This is a programming error and should not happen. An exception will be thrown.
 * 2. If `SharedLock` requests a mutex G and the thread already has a `ExclusiveLock U`:
 *    2.1. If U **does not own** G, throw and exception.
 *         This is a programming error and should not happen.
 *    2.2. If U **owns** G, do nothing. Just pretend we acquired the lock.
